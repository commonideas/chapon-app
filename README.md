## About The Project

The Shopify Subscriptions Reference app is an example of how to build a subscriptions application with [Remix](https://remix.run/). The reference app includes the basic features of the [Shopify Subscription app](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-subscriptions) and serves as a starting point or example app for building subscription applications.

We developed the Shopify Subscriptions Reference app with the following in mind:

- **Build a custom subscriptions solution** that meets your commerce needs.
- **Build faster** using the source code from the [Shopify Subscriptions Reference app](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-subscriptions).
- **The core [building blocks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/purchase-options/subscriptions/subscriptions-app/core-system-components) you need to build an app** that integrates with Shopifyâ€™s ecosystem.

### App Store submission

The [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/) is the place where Shopify merchants find the applications that they'll use to support their business. As an app partner, you can create applications for the Shopify App Store and reach an international audience of an ever-growing number of entrepreneurs.

Ensure that you follow the list of App Store requirements if you're interested in building applications for the Shopify platform.

If you're building an application for the Shopify App Store, then you can use the Shopify Subscriptions Reference App as a starting point. However, the application that you submit needs to be [substantively different](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/purchase-options/subscriptions/subscriptions-app#uniqueness-from-other-apps) from the reference application so that it provides added value for merchants.

## Getting Started

To create a new subscriptions app, use the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli) and run the installation command.

```bash
shopify app init --template https://github.com/Shopify/subscriptions-reference-app
```

This command clones the Shopify Subscription App repository and installs all the dependencies needed to run the app.

Follow the [Shopify Subscriptions Reference app documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/purchase-options/subscriptions/subscriptions-app/start-building) to learn how to run the application.

### Clone the app

You can also clone the app from the repository, once you have cloned the app, you can install the dependencies by running one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
pnpm install
```

From there, you can follow the [Shopify Subscriptions Reference app documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/purchase-options/subscriptions/subscriptions-app/start-building) to learn how to run the application and ask for scopes.
